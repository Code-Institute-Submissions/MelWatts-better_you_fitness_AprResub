            <p>Fitness has been my passion since a young age. Becoming a PT has allowed me to help my clients achieve
              their goals without sacrificing their happiness and lifestyle. I find my job rewarding when I see the
              confidence, strength and wellbeing my clients have from training.I am a personal trainer and a sponsored
              toned figure athlete. However big or small your goal is, I will
              give you the best support and guidance to achieve it together.</p>

            <h2>Diego Noble</h2>
            <p>All my clients get nutritional education, and easy to implement exercise routines that will transform
              your body from fat loss to muscle toning. No extreme diets. No 7 day gym routines. Just long lasting
              results from a routine built around you. or over 20 years, I have been involved in different sports and
              training. I see fitness as a lifestyle, it helps you live a healthy and balanced life. I like all types of
              training, especially functional training, which helps in everyday tasks.</p>
