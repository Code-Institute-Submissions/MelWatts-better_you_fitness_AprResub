## Strategy

### User Needs

As a user the site has to be accessible on mobile, tablet and all browsers. Information should be clear to read, informative and helpful.
The site navigation needs to be optimal to move to the preferred section of the user.

### Business vision

The purpose of this project is to give users peace of mind that help and advice or just something to do socially, is out there. 
The site also gives the users easy access to personal trainers and book specific classes for their needs.

### Testing

## Testing Plan

Starting this project I know what my target audience would like to see on a website with fitness as its topic (I'm a fitness freak as well). I took into consideration on what devices my users would like to see the website on. For testing I designed the website mobile first, with extensive testing using Chrome DevTools for all Iphone's. Using DevTools I continued testing the website using settings for the Ipad and a 15.6 inch laptop screen. For large screens I used a 24 inch monitor. I wanted my page to be seen in a horizantel manner on larger screens a vertical manner for small screens, and on medium sized screens I am aiming to be in the middle of these two.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

## First Time Visitor Goals

As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

* Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Sign up for a free 7 day trial" Call to action button.
* The main points are made immediately with the navigation bar and call to action button.
* The user has three options, click the call to action buttons, scroll through the information and tips or click on the navigation bar to go directly to the place they need.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

* The site has been designed to be fluid and informative, easy to navigate. Each link describes what section the visitor will end up on.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want them to locate our social media links to see our following on social media to determine how trusted and known we are.

* Once the new visitor has read through the site, feel confident they can contact us using teh call to action modal on the home page.
* The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate the social media links in the footer.

## Returning Visitor Goals

As a Returning Visitor, I want the visitor to find the where they were previously and feel confident to make teh step to improve their fitness or weight loss goals.

As a Returning Visitor, I want them to find the best way to get in contact with us with any questions they may have.

* The home page clearly highlights the "Sign up" Modal.

* Here they can fill out the form on the page or alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
* The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page.
* Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
* As a Returning Visitor, I want them to find the Facebook Group link so that they can join and interact with others in the community.

* The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

## Frequent User Goals

As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added help, advice or new trainers.

* The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the call to action buttons or the navigation bar.
* As a Frequent User, I want them to check to see if there are any new infomation, tips, help or trainers.
* The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the links to external sites.
* As a Frequent User, I want them to follow us on social media.

### Further Testing

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhone X.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all sections were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Implementation

Testing was mainly done using DevTools in google chrome. 
Starting mobile first then working my way up to bigger screen sizes. 
Whenever an element wasn't located where I wanted it to be I would use the `element.style` box in DevTools to find a solution. 

I used the WC3 code validators to check my code for mistakes as well. 

Testing is done in the following way: 

1. Scroll up and down the page checking for overflow and general positioning of items.
2. Use navigation bar to move to section of the page. 
3. In the form, try and click the button to check whether all fields are required to be filled in, check as well whether the e-mail part was set to e-mail.
4. Check all links in the footer whether they react as intended by opening in a new tab (for links section in footer). 
5. Run through all of these steps for each different screen size.
6. Use HTML and CSS validators from W3C schools to find mistakes in code.


### Results

Once I had a general idea on how to run testing I followed all steps for each of my pages which gave me the following results:

* 2 class to one div, this was rectified
* Tried having control="" on my iframe.
* Tried having muted on my iframe. 
* Tried having loop on my iframe.
* I have 3 warnings left to rectify, all are 'Section lacks heading'.


* HTML-validator results: [index.html](assets/images/html-results/index-results.png)

* CSS-validator results: [style.css](assets/images/css-validator.JPG)



### Bugs

#### Media query

After writing my media query for a mobile, I noticed that, that was overwriting my desktop version. After a lot of meetings with my mentor and lots of chat and help from my fellow students on Slack, it was decided that all of my website was not set in columns or grids, once this was done everything was much clearer.

#### Images

Early on I was having a hard time getting the images to display properly. They looked good on a desktop version but wasn't scaling properly for tablet or mobile. This was due to using px height and width instead of %.



## Deployment

This project is deployed using gitpod in combination with github pages.
I used gitpod to write all code and seeing it is linked with github it was easy to use the terminal to commit, unfortunately in my haste I have committed a few spelling errors of which I did a quick google search to see if I could rectify this, I couldn't see a way.

### GitHub Pages

## The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
   * Alternatively Click Here for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
